              My name is Sara Gryka. I am a creative dreamer working on becoming a web developer. I love problem
              solving and new challenges, so bring them my way!
              <br>
              <br>

              I am happily married and a fur mom to two big dogs, that are actually just huge babies. I am
              originally from Michigan and miss the summers especially when we are fighting the summer heat here
              in Arizona. Most of our family is still back in the midwest, but we have found a new home here in
              Arizona. I don't know if we will ever get used to the desert, but we sure do love the sunshine!
              <br>
              <br>
              Some of my favorite things to do are travel, hike, and just get out into nature and enjoy! I love
              music and am always listening to something.
